# asteroids

An Asteroids Game in Python

Part of learning series at [boot.dev](https://boot.dev/)

## Scores

There are 3 types of asteroids:

* Big - 20 points
* Medium - 40 points
* Small - 80

The player starts with 3 lives and can gain a life for every 100 asteroids destroyed.

> **Note:**
> There is a maximum of 5 lives.

## Improvements Ideas

* ~~Add a scoring system~~
* ~~Implement multiple lives and respawning~~
* Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
* Add acceleration to the player movement
* Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
* Add a background image
* Create different weapon types
* Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
* Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
* Add a shield power-up
* Add a speed power-up
* Add bombs that can be dropped
* Add unit tests
* Add a game over screen
